"""
    Polymorphism :  it is a combination of multiple forms.

    Poly -> Many
    morphism -> Forms

    example : Bird.

             Reaction
              

    There are 2 types of it.

    1) Compile Time Polymorphsim (Static Polymorphsim) or (Early Binding Polymorphism)

        e.g Method Overloading

            - Different return-type
            - Same Function-name
            - Different parameters/arguments
            
    
    2) Run Time Polymorphism    (Dynamic Polymorphism) or (Late Binding Polymorphism)

        e.g Method Overriding

            - Same return-type
            - Same function-name
            - Same arguments

            -Method Signature same.


        - Python does not support compile time polymorphsim. ie (Method Overloading)
